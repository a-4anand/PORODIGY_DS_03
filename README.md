# Decision_Tree_Classifier_for_Predicting_Customer_Purchases

This repository contains code for building a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. The classifier is trained using a custom dataset provided by the user.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the classifier contains the following features:

- `customer_id`: Unique identifier for each customer.
- `age`: Age of the customer.
- `gender`: Gender of the customer (Male/Female).
- `annual_income`: Annual income of the customer.
- `credit_score`: Credit score of the customer.
- `employed`: Employment status of the customer (Yes/No).
- `marital_status`: Marital status of the customer.
- `no_of_children`: Number of children the customer has.
- `responded`: Target variable indicating whether the customer responded positively to a marketing campaign (Yes/No).

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone <repository_url>
```

2. Install the required dependencies (assuming you have Python installed):

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to build and train the decision tree classifier:

```
python decision_tree_classifier.py
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Jupyter notebook (optional, if using the provided notebook)
